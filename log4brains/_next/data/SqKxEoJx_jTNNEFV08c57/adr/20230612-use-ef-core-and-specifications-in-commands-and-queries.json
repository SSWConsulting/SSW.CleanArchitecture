It also provided an abstraction layer that was not providing a huge amount of value.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Ensure that abstractions offer significant benefit\n- Ensure DB queries are efficient\n- Enable smooth transition to DDD when needed\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n2. EF Core + Specifications\n3. EF Core\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen **Option 2 - EF Core + Specifications**, because it provides a good balance of query reusability, efficient querying of the DB, and allows for aggregate roots to be loaded in a consistent way.\n\n### Consequences\n\n- ❌ Unable to unit test commands and queries.  Will need to leverage integration tests due to EF Core.\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Ardalis.Specification.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ⚖️ Specifications will live external to the command/query\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### 1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Allows Unit testing of Commands and Queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ❌ Cannot efficiently project onto DTO.  Ardalis.Repository executes the query internally and returns back full entity.\n\n### 2. EF Core + Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ✅ Can efficiently project onto DTO\n- ❌ Commands/Queries cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Dependency on EF Core added to Application\n\n### 3. EF Core\n\n- ✅ Easier to add new DB queries (i.e. less abstractions)\n- ❌ Harder to load aggregates as you must manually include the required entities\n- ❌ Cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Commands/Queries Cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Dependency on EF Core added to Application\n"},"creationDate":"2023-06-14T07:18:11.000Z","lastEditDate":"2023-06-14T07:18:11.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":null,"file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20230612-use-ef-core-and-specifications-in-commands-and-queries.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20230612-use-ef-core-and-specifications-in-commands-and-queries.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20230612-use-ef-core-and-specifications-in-commands-and-queries.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
