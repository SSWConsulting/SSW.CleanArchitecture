How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a

Statement\n\nThe current approach of using Repositories and Specifications for queries did not allow for efficient data retrieval from the database.  It also provided an abstraction layer that was not providing a huge amount of value.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Ensure that abstractions offer significant benefit\n- Ensure DB queries are efficient\n- Enable smooth transition to DDD when needed\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n2. EF Core + Specifications\n3. EF Core\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen **Option 2 - EF Core + Specifications**, because it provides a good balance of query reusability, efficient querying of the DB, and allows for aggregate roots to be loaded in a consistent way.\n\n### Consequences\n\n- ❌ Unable to unit test commands and queries.  Will need to leverage integration tests due to EF Core.\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Ardalis.Specification.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ⚖️ Specifications will live external to the command/query\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### 1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Allows Unit testing of Commands and Queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ❌ Cannot efficiently project onto DTO.  Ardalis.Repository executes the query internally and returns back full entity.\n\n### 2.
