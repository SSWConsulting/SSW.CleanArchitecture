patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a

Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n2. EF Core + Specifications\n3. EF Core\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen **Option 2 - EF Core + Specifications**, because it provides a good balance of query reusability, efficient querying of the DB, and allows for aggregate roots to be loaded in a consistent way.\n\n### Consequences\n\n- ❌ Unable to unit test commands and queries.  Will need to leverage integration tests due to EF Core.\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Ardalis.Specification.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ⚖️ Specifications will live external to the command/query\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### 1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Allows Unit testing of Commands and Queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ❌ Cannot efficiently project onto DTO.  Ardalis.Repository executes the query internally and returns back full entity.\n\n### 2. EF Core + Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ✅ Can efficiently project onto DTO\n- ❌ Commands/Queries cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Dependency on EF Core added to Application\n\n### 3. EF Core\n\n- ✅ Easier to add new DB queries (i.e. less abstractions)\n- ❌ Harder to load aggregates as you must manually include the required entities\n- ❌ Cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Commands/Queries Cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Dependency on EF Core added to Application\n"}],["20230604-use-the-factory-pattern-to-create-aggregates",{"title":"Use the Factory Pattern to Create Aggregates","verbatim":"\nTechnical Story: [SSW.CleanArchitecture | Issues | 111](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/issues/111)\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nAggregate roots can be instantiated in a way that satisfies all the decision drivers.  What is the best way to create aggregates?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Must work well with EF Core\n- Must be able to raise domain events on object creation\n- Must keep aggregate roots in a valid state at all times\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Factory Methods\n2. Constructors\n3. `required init` properties\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen **Option 1. Factory Methods**, because it is the only option that meets all the decision drivers.\n\n## Consequences\n\n- Private constructors can be used to ensure that aggregates are always in a valid state\n- Need to use `null!` to remove nullable warnings\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### 1. Factory Methods\n\n- ✅ EF Core can still create the aggregate when hydrating data from the DB\n- ✅ Domain events can be raised when aggregates are created via the application, but not when they are hydrated from the DB\n- ✅ Provides a consistent way to create aggregates\n- ✅ Aggregates remain encapsulated\n\n### 2. Constructors\n\n- ❌ EF will incorrectly raise domain events when hydrating data from the DB\n- ❌ EF does not allow owned entities to be passed to constructors\n\n### 3. `required init` properties\n\n- ❌ Properties need to be passed to constructors to ensure they are in a valid state on object creation.  Can't use `required init` properties as they then become unmodifiable\n"}],["20230810-move-specifications-to-the-domain",{"title":"Move Specifications to the Domain Layer","verbatim":"\nTechnical Story: [SSW.CleanArchitecture | Issues | 139](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/issues/139)\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe primary use cases for specifications are to:\n\n1.
