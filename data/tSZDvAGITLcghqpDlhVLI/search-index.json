How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a

Commands and Queries","verbatim":"\nTechnical Story: [SSW.CleanArchitecture | Issues | 115](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/issues/115)\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe current approach of using Repositories and Specifications for queries did not allow for efficient data retrieval from the database.  It also provided an abstraction layer that was not providing a huge amount of value.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Ensure that abstractions offer significant benefit\n- Ensure DB queries are efficient\n- Enable smooth transition to DDD when needed\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n2. EF Core + Specifications\n3. EF Core\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen **Option 2 - EF Core + Specifications**, because it provides a good balance of query reusability, efficient querying of the DB, and allows for aggregate roots to be loaded in a consistent way.\n\n### Consequences\n\n- ❌ Unable to unit test commands and queries.  Will need to leverage integration tests due to EF Core.\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ❌ Application will depend on `Ardalis.Specification.EntityFrameworkCore`\n- ⚖️ Specifications will live external to the command/query\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### 1. Ardalis Repositories and Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Allows Unit testing of Commands and Queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ❌ Cannot efficiently project onto DTO.  Ardalis.Repository executes the query internally and returns back full entity.\n\n### 2. EF Core + Specifications\n\n- ✅ Easy to load Aggregate Roots\n- ✅ Specifications can be reused for queries\n- ✅ Specifications can be individually unit tested\n- ✅ Can efficiently project onto DTO\n- ❌ Commands/Queries cannot be unit tested\n- ❌ Dependency on EF Core added to Application\n\n### 3.

They keep our code minimal as we don't need to add specific handling into every API endpoint. However, we still need to ensure these status codes are documented correctly.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that we're using exceptions as flow control.
