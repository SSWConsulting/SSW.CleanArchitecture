By incorporating Domain-Driven Design (DDD), projects with non-trivial logic can better accommodate complex workflows and business rule integrations without compromising maintainability or scalability.\n\nWe would like to default to using DDD in the template and provide a good example of building applications in that manner.\n\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Anemic Domain Model\n2. Rich Domain Model with DDD\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 2 - Rich Domain Model with DDD\", because it helps set developers up for success when building complex applications.  It's easier to go from a rich domain model to an anemic domain model than the other way around.\n\n### Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Need to create a new Domain model to show the usefulness of DDD.  This will require most layers to be rebuilt.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### Option 1 - Anemic Domain Model\n\n- ✅ Simplier for trivial applications\n- ❌ Difficult to upgrade to use DDD patterns\n\n### Option 2 - Rich Domain Model with DDD\n\n- ✅ Easy to migrate to an anemic domain model if needed\n- ✅ More flexible for complex applications\n- ❌ Overkill for trivial applications\n- ❌ More complex to understand\n"},"creationDate":"2024-04-15T02:18:09.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-04-15T02:18:09.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-04-04T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20240404-use-domain-driven-design-tactical-patterns.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20240404-use-domain-driven-design-tactical-patterns.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20240404-use-domain-driven-design-tactical-patterns.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
