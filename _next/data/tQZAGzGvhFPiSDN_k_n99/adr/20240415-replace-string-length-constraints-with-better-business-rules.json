(Recommended) Replace string length constraints with non-technical requirement\n2. Drop string length constraints and do not replace them\n3. Keep string length constraints but split the constants to each domain\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Replace string length constraints with non-technical requirement\", because we want to\nkeep the example of guard clauses in the code.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### 1. Replace string length constraints with non-technical requirement\n\n- ✅ Guard clauses example\n- ✅ No shared constraint values\n- ❌ No example of linking domain constraints to infrastructure implementation\n\n### 2. Drop string length constraints and do not replace them\n\n- ✅ No shared constants\n- ❌ No guard clauses example\n\n### 3. Keep string length constraints but split the constants to each domain\n\n- ✅ No changes to code\n- ✅ Guard clauses example\n- ❌ Shared constraint values for different entities / across aggregate root\n- ❌ Template starts with limit to string length which might not be needed / different value needed for different projects\n\n"},"creationDate":"2024-04-15T07:06:49.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-04-15T07:06:49.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Chris Clement [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-04-15T13:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20240415-replace-string-length-constraints-with-better-business-rules.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20240415-replace-string-length-constraints-with-better-business-rules.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20240415-replace-string-length-constraints-with-better-business-rules.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
