Versions 8 and beyond are free for open-source projects and non-commercial use, but commercial use requires a paid licence.\n\nVersion 7 will remain fully open-source indefinitely and receive bugfixes and other important corrections.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Free for commercial use\n- Concise and readable assertions\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Shouldly\n2. Fluent Assertions (free version)\n3. Fluent Assertions (paid version)\n4. Native test framework assertions (e.g. xUnit/NUnit/TUnit)\n5. Awesome Assertions\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 5 - Awesome Assertions\", because we get the same experience as FluentAssertions, but it is free for commercial use. It is also easy to migrate from FluentAssertions to Awesome Assertions.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### Option 1 - Shouldly\n\nhttps://docs.shouldly.org/\n\n- ✅ Good assertion library\n- ✅ Free for commercial use\n- ❌ Would require a lot of work to migrate from FluentAssertions\n- ❌ Custom extensions would need to be rewritten\n\n### Option 2 - Fluent Assertions (free version)\n\nhttps://xceed.com/products/unit-testing/fluent-assertions/\n\n- ✅ Great assertion library\n- ✅ Version 7 is Free for open-source projects and non-commercial use\n- ❌ Easy to upgrade to version 8, resulting in substantial licence fees\n\n### Option 3 - Fluent Assertions (paid version)\n\nhttps://xceed.com/products/unit-testing/fluent-assertions/\n\n- ✅ Great assertion library\n- ❌ Substantial licence fees for commercial use. ($130 per developer per year. For SSW this would cost $7,410 per year for 57 developers)\n\n### Option 4 - Native test framework assertions (e.g. xUnit/NUnit/TUnit)\n\n- ✅ Free for commercial use\n- ✅ No additional dependencies\n- ❌ Assertions are not as readable as FluentAssertions\n- ❌ Would require a lot of work to migrate from FluentAssertions\n- ❌ Custom extensions would need to be rewritten\n\n### Option 5 - Awesome Assertions\n\nhttps://awesomeassertions.org/\n\n- ✅ Great assertion library\n- ✅ Free for commercial use\n- ✅ Easy to migrate from FluentAssertions\n- ✅ Custom extensions will continue to work (with minor modifications)\n"},"creationDate":"2025-03-26T00:33:16.000Z","lastEditDate":"2025-03-26T00:33:16.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":"2025-03-26T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20250326-migrate-to-awesome-assertions.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20250326-migrate-to-awesome-assertions.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20250326-migrate-to-awesome-assertions.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
