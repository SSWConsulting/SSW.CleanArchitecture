While saving some work, this can also lead more complicate mappers, and runtime issues due to missing fields or mappings.\n\nWhile mappers solve a problem in a certain set of cases, they can also introduce complexity and runtime issues, and are not a sensible default.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Reduce runtime errors\n- Reduce tooling removing 'unused' properties\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. AutoMapper\n2. Manual Mapper\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 2 - Manual Mapper\", because it reduces the runtime errors, and makes both simple and complex mapping scenarios easier to understand.\n\n### Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- ✅ Once Automapper is removed, we can remove the mapping profiles from the code\n- ✅ DTOs can now use records, making the code much simpler\n- ✅ With much more concise code, we can fit everything in one file\n- ✅ With everything in one file, we can remove a layer of folders\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Option 1 - AutoMapper\n\n- ✅ Less code to write for simple mapping scenarios\n- ❌ Mapping becomes complex for complicated scenarios\n- ❌ Can lead to runtime issues due to missing fields or mappings\n- ❌ Need to learn a new library\n\n### Option 2 - Manual Mapper\n\n- ✅ Mapping becomes simple for both simple and complicated scenarios\n- ✅ Reduced runtime issues due to missing fields or mappings\n- ✅ No need to learn a new library\n- ❌ More code needed for mapping\n\n## Links\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsnEZdc3MrE\n"},"creationDate":"2024-11-18T06:55:01.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-11-18T23:41:08.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-11-18T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20241118-replace-automapper-with-manual-mapping.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20241118-replace-automapper-with-manual-mapping.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20241118-replace-automapper-with-manual-mapping.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
