However, they can be a bit of a pain to set up especially with EF Core. We want to make it easier to use strongly typed IDs or any simple value objects in our projects.\n\n## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->\n\n- Simplify usage of strongly typed IDs\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. Manual Approach\n2. Vogen\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 2 - Vogen\", because configuration, validation, and usage of strongly typed IDs is much simpler (espeicially from the EF Core point of view).\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### Option 1 - Manual Approach\n\n- ✅ Avoid additional dependencies\n- ❌ Extra EF Core boilerplate needed\n- ❌ Not easy to add value object validation with current record-based approach\n\n### Option 2 - Vogen\n\n- ✅ Simple to create and use strongly typed IDs\n- ✅ Easy to add value object validation\n- ✅ Easy to add EF Core configuration\n- ✅ Can be used for any simple value object\n- ❌ Extra dependency added\n\n## Links\n\n- https://stevedunn.github.io/Vogen/overview.html\n- https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen\n"},"creationDate":"2024-11-18T22:57:05.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-11-18T23:41:08.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-11-19T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20241118-use-vogen-to-simplify-strongly-typed-ids.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20241118-use-vogen-to-simplify-strongly-typed-ids.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20241118-use-vogen-to-simplify-strongly-typed-ids.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
