If you do drill in you will find exceptions specific to the underlying DB Provider.  But what if you change provider?  Now you need to handle multiple exceptions for the same error.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Produce strongly typed useful exceptions\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 1\", because it does what we need and is far better than the default EF Core exceptions.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Option 1 - EntityFrameworkCore.Exceptions.SqlServer\n\n- ✅ Strongly typed exceptions\n- ❌ Additional dependency added\n"},"creationDate":"2024-11-18T07:32:21.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-11-18T07:32:21.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Daniel Mackay [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-11-18T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20241118-produce-useful-sql-server-exceptions.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20241118-produce-useful-sql-server-exceptions.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20241118-produce-useful-sql-server-exceptions.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
