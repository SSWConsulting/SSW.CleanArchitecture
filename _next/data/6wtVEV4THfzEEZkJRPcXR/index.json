You are free to edit it as you want -->\n\n# Architecture knowledge base\n\nWelcome üëã to the architecture knowledge base of SSW Clean Architecture Template.\nYou will find here all the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) of the project.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\n> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.\n> An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitutes its decision log.\n\nAn ADR is immutable: only its status can change (i.e., become deprecated or superseded). That way, you can become familiar with the whole project history just by reading its decision log in chronological order.\nMoreover, maintaining this documentation aims at:\n\n- üöÄ Improving and speeding up the onboarding of a new team member\n- üî≠ Avoiding blind acceptance/reversal of a past decision (cf [Michael Nygard's famous article on ADRs](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html))\n- ü§ù Formalizing the decision process of the team\n\n## Usage\n\nThis website is automatically updated after a change on the `main` branch of the project's Git repository.\nIn fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with markdown files located next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep it up-to-date.\nYou can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.\n\nThe typical workflow of an ADR is the following:\n\n![ADR workflow](/l4b-static/adr-workflow.png)\n\nThe decision process is entirely collaborative and backed by pull requests.\n\n## More information\n\n- [Log4brains documentation](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#readme)\n- [What is an ADR and why should you use them](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#-what-is-an-adr-and-why-should-you-use-them)\n- [ADR GitHub organization](https://adr.github.io/)\n","l4bVersion":"1.1.0"},"__N_SSG":true}
