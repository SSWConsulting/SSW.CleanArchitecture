However, this does not include the Swagger UI that previously came with NSwag. We need to decide if we should continue to use NSwag or switch to the new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` library, and if we should use the Swagger UI or another tool to view the OpenAPI spec.\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. NSwag with Swagger UI\n2. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` with Swagger UI\n3. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` with [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar)\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Option 3 - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` with [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar)\", because we should use the built-in .NET library for generating OpenAPI spec files, and Scalar is a modern, lightweight, and fast alternative to Swagger UI.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### 1. NSwag with Swagger UI\n\n- ✅ Tried and tested solution\n- ❌ Does not use the 1st Party .NET library\n- ❌ Dependency on additional NuGet package(Nswag.AspNetCore, Nswag.MSBuild)\n\n### 2. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` with Swagger UI\n\n- ✅ Uses the 1st Party .NET library\n- ✅ Uses well-known Swagger UI\n- ❌ Dependency additional NuGet package (Swashbuckle)\n\n### 3. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` with [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar)\n\n- ✅ Uses the 1st Party .NET library\n- ✅ Modern, lightweight, and fast alternative to Swagger UI\n- ❌ Dependency additional NuGet package (Scalar.AspNetCore)\n- ❌ Scalar - Relatively new and unknown compared to Swagger UI\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://github.com/scalar/scalar\n- https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/aspnetcore-openapi?view=aspnetcore-9.0\n"},"creationDate":"2024-10-23T06:01:24.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-10-23T06:01:24.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Matthew Parker [SSW]","publicationDate":"2024-10-23T12:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20241023-use-net-openapi-and-scalar-over-nswag-and-swagger.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/SSW.CleanArchitecture/SSW.CleanArchitecture/docs/adr/20241023-use-net-openapi-and-scalar-over-nswag-and-swagger.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/master/docs/adr/20241023-use-net-openapi-and-scalar-over-nswag-and-swagger.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
