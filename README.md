## 🤔 What is it?

This is a template for creating a new project using [Clean Architecture](https://ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-clean-architecture/), leveraging [SSW Rules](https://ssw.com.au/rules) & SSW's over 30 years of experience developing software in the Microsoft space.

## 🚀 Publishing Template

Template will be published to NuGet.org when changes are made to `CleanArchitecture.nuspec` on the `main` branch.

### Process

1. Update the `version` attribute in `CleanArchitecture.nuspec`
2. Merge your PR
3. `package` GitHub Action will run and publish the new version to NuGet.org
4. Create a GitHub release to document the changes

<!-- TODO Issue #99: Getting Started using the dotnet new template -->

## 🎉 Getting Started

1. Install the SSW CA template

```bash
dotnet new install SSW.CleanArchitecture.Template
```

> NOTE: The template only needs to be installed once. Running this command again will update your version of the template.

2. Create a new directory

```bash
mkdir Northwind365
cd Northwind365
```

3. Create a new solution

```bash
dotnet new ssw-ca
```

> NOTE: `name` is optional; if you don't specify it, the directory name will be used as the solution name and project namespaces.

Alternatively, you can specify the `name` and `output` directory as follows:
  
```bash
dotnet new ssw-ca --name {{SolutionName}} --output .\
```

4. Create a query

```bash
cd src/Application/Features
mkdir {{FeatureName}}
cd {{FeatureName}}
dotnet new ssw-ca-query --name {{QueryName}} --entityName {{Entity}} --namespaceRoot {{Namespace}}
```

5. Create a command

```bash
cd src/Application/Features
mkdir {{FeatureName}}
cd {{FeatureName}}
dotnet new ssw-ca-command --name {{CommandName}} --entityName {{Entity}} --namespaceRoot {{Namespace}}
```
